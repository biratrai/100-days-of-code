# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 18 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Forked the Android fundamentals repository from google, started on my Hello Kotlin series, converted the Java code into Kotlin.

**Thoughts:** It is still intial foray into Kotlin language. The desire to start on Kotlin was when GoogleIO confirmed it, but was too lazy to have a look into it. Hopefully the christmas vacation and free time will help me start my coding habits and in the process learn about cool things in android world.

### Day 1: Dec 19 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued on my Hello Kotlin series, converted the Java code into Kotlin. Added MyActivity and some initial dive into testing in Kotlin

**Thoughts:** Too much of writing and learning Kotlin. Much much better than Java
